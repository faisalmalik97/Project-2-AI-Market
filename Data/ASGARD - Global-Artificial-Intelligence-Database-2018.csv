By incorporating neural network anomaly detection techniques, algorithms will be developed that track specific critical components and their unique identification across different platforms and rotary aircraft in order to evaluate both new and historic flight load parameter information associated with the operation of these multiple critical components. Combining this information with Health Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) data bases, algorithms will be developed that can both predict anomalous behaviors associated with extended flight load parameters, as well as forecast 'just in time' (optimal component retirement life cycles) and outline interim maintenance diagnostic decision points. The fatigue tracking system will further utilize advanced diagnostics and prognostics through the HUMS platform to improve battle readiness of the components and systems, as well as minimize maintenance costs over the life-cycle of the component.

United States,Georgia,McDonough,Guided Systems Technologies,Robotics,"Guided Systems Technologies is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Adaptive Methods for Target Tracking, and Guidance and Control for the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Ballistic missiles pose formidable challenges for target tracking and intercept because of their spiraling dynamics and significant maneuverability potential as they re-enter the atmosphere at high speeds. Recent studies have shown that conventional methods to estimation, guidance and control design are unable to guarantee sufficient accuracy against such highly maneuvering targets. This is not unexpected since the coupling between the individual elements is not accounted for completely using the conventional design paradigm, and the separation principle which is implicit in such designs can break down in engagements that require high maneuverability. To meet these challenges we propose developing i) adaptive integrated guidance and control (G&C) designs for increased performance and robustness to uncertain interceptor dynamics, ii) adaptive target-state estimation designs for increased performance and robustness against maneuvering targets, iii) an integrated design method for combining adaptive target-state estimation and adaptive G&C designs for improving overall system performance, and iv) collision avoidance methods to avoid mutual kill-vehicle collisions. The adaptive methods are based on flight proven Neural-Network based adaptive control algorithms. We expect that our strategy for integrated adaptive designs can produce never before achieved levels of lethality for the intercept of future maneuvering targets.",http://www.guidedsys.com

Their Phase I project will implement a physician-assisted, real-time adaptive system for the segmentation of anatomical structures in 3D medical image data. Medical image segmentation seeks to change the representation of an anatomical structure, making it more easily analyzed. Because of the extreme variability of these structures in biological systems, current idiosyncratic manual methods currently in use are tedious, time consuming, and error prone. Image segmentation cannot in general be programmatically solved. The proposed system is a Neural Network (NN) based adaptation of the individual data using parallel Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and coupled with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based adaptation across GPU cores. The system will build a diagnostically useful segmentation of the anatomical feature within seconds from an area of interest outlined by a physician using a Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Fast growth in medical imaging overwhelms available diagnosticians. An intuitive and inexpensive system to quickly and accurately deliver diagnostic relevant segmentation of medical images offers tremendous commercial value. Currently, each scan requires approximately 50 minutes of manual preparation. The diagnosis and treatment of an estimated 20 percent of diseases benefit from medical imaging. Newer scanning technologies have increased in resolution, but such techniques have not made segmenting easier or faster.

United States,Texas,College Station,Knowledge Based Systems,Core AI,"Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Framework for Enabling Adaptive Scenario Generation for Training (FEAST).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: We propose to design and demonstrate a Framework for Enabling Adaptive Scenario Generation for Training (FEAST). We will design an innovative methodology that enables dynamic scenario generation and adaptation for individual and team learning in simulation- based environments. We propose (i) a robust knowledge based approach to facilitate the rapid generation and refinement of distributed mission operations training scenarios and (ii) innovative knowledge discovery and automated reasoning methods to allow for the seamless evolution of scenario design knowledge over extended time. The proposed Phase I effort will (i) establish requirements for a dynamic scenario generation for individual and team learning in simulation-based environments, (ii) design a FEAST solution architecture, and (iii) demonstrate proof-of-concept FEAST technology. Phase II will design and demonstrate focused and scalable FEAST simulation-based training application.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Ships Lifecycle Affordability Model (SLAM).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Early design stage cost modeling tools in use by the Navy typically ignore lifecycle and sustainment costs, as the acquisition community functions separately from the operations community and with a completely separate budget. Recently, congressional committees and Navy senior management (civilian and uniformed) have recognized that there is a wide disparity between purchasing what you can afford, and then affording what you purchase. This gap between acquisition, production and operations needs to be addressed as early as possible through innovative and modern approaches to ship cost estimating, effectively eliminating the term ship design cost estimate and replacing with ship lifecycle affordability model. Knowledge Based Systems Inc. (KBSI) proposes to incorporate a systems dynamics approach to cost modeling, effectively combining discrete, linear, and hierarchical cost estimating methods with non-linear system dynamics modeling tools that account for variables that influence producibility and sustainability and change over time or refine themselves based on the current state of other influencing variables. This system dynamics approach to a Ships Lifecycle Affordability Model (SLAM), combined with production based, rather than systems based, early stage models will create visibility of cost drivers and potential cost drivers that currently remain hidden using existing cost estimating tools and methodologies.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Automated Planning Software For A Dynamic Heterogeneous Collection Of Manned And Unmanned Entities.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The objective of the proposed effort is to design, develop, and deploy a goal-directed, automated asset employment and redeployment planning framework to provide commanders and their planning staff with tools to more rapidly and effectively (i) maintain situation awareness of world state conditions, constraints, and goals governing the planned use of manned platforms and robotic entities; (ii) rapidly generate candidate plans for the effective use of these assets; and (iii) identify and select a plan to most effectively address current and anticipated needs.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Environment, Epidemiology, and Etiology Surveillance and Analysis Toolkit (E3SAT).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: The goal of this SBIR initiative is to design and develop an Environment, Epidemiology, and Etiology Surveillance and Analysis Toolkit (E3SAT) that will provide a research data cube and analysis tool suite to enable researchers to collect, integrate and data mine medical records, environmental exposures, and deployment locations. The data assembled will include medical records including signs, symptoms, diagnosis, orders, and outcomes (from AHLTA system), environmental issues (from DOEHRS system), and deployment profiles. The analysis supported includes environmental, epidemiological and etiological issues, causes and effects, discovery of correlations and causalities, and hypothesis testing. E3SAT will supplement the standard data available from AHLTA and DOEHRS with information retrieved from public sources on local and regional environmental patterns and with epidemiology information. It will accept inputs and annotations from Subject Matter Experts (SME) related to environmental data as well as hypotheses that need to be validated. E3SAT allows researchers and practitioners to interact seamlessly with the integrated analysis cube and for a time phased longitudinal view of individual records as well as latitudinal view across multiple soldiers. It allows for drill down into data supporting a discovered hypothesis, epidemiology, and pattern; or drilling up to view similar symptoms or environmental exposure cluster.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Open Source Information Tactical Exploitation (ONSITE).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: We propose to design and demonstrate the ONSITE Natural Language Processing technology. ONSITE uses innovative approach to NLP focused on achieving state of the art processing throughput in the presence of noisy input data which achieving semantically rich extractions from unstructured open source text to support tactical applications requiring accelerated operational timelines. ONSITE seeks to strike the correct balance in the design of NLP algorithms for fast execution on a single laptop computer while still providing useful semantically rich extractions. Floating-point and math related operations are limited in favor of optimized heuristics leading to higher rates of CPU throughput and at the same time supporting the structuring of calculations to allow increased CPU cache utilization. ONSITE incorporates the use of specially constructed ontologies to increase processing throughput and increased semantic resolution of extractions. The initial ONSITE application proposed by KBSI is influence operations targeted at enemy networks both physical (existing in the real world) and virtual (existing online). However, the set of supported tactical applications provided by ONSITE may be extended to different tactical application areas including patrol mission planning, insurgent extraction, hostage rescue, and targeting.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Framework for Enabling Adaptive Scenario Generation for Training (FEAST).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: We propose to design and demonstrate a Framework for Enabling Adaptive Scenario Generation for Training (FEAST).

Phase II will design and demonstrate focused and scalable FEAST simulation-based training application.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Entropy-Trust-Homology Operational Security (ETHOS).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Secure and semi-secure distributed networks rely on static security protocols and certificate authorities to attempt to assure trust between network participants. Trust is based on what others initially think of the participant and not on what the participant actually says or does. Trust should be based not only on initial impressions but also on subsequent participation in the network. KBSI proposes an Entropy-Trust-Homology Operational Security (ETHOS) method of securing trust based on the information that is exchanged between the different edges of the communication network. Trust entropy metrics would be developed based on the pattern of information entropy flow between edges and on usage behavior. The metrics would be updated by a hardware device residing at each edge. The hardware device would use graph-based data mining techniques to update the metrics and autonomically collaborate with other edges in a distributed manner. The distributed collaboration would result in a secure, verifiable network where trust is based on what the edges do rather than solely on who the edges say the are.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Parasitic Power Pack (P3).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Parasitic Power Pack (P3) is a modular power generation device that will fit into a 3-inch diameter free floating buoy on the ocean surface. P3 will not interfere with the antenna on the upper portion of the buoy and will not occupy more than 20 inches in length producing a steady power output of at least 4 milliwatts with a capacity to store at least 60 joules of energy. Of the different energy harvesting concepts for powering wireless sensors we use the incessant oscillations of the ocean waves under which the buoy is excited. Unlike regular wave energy devices that are tuned to ocean waves, we have a platform whose dimensions are preset for a specific purpose. Our intent in this effort is to design this platform which is not tethered to the ocean bottom, but a robust maintenance free design that can survive the shock loads that will be imposed on delivery and one that will survive other operating conditions that it could be subjected to. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology through mechanical and electrical modeling.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: The Secure NeTcentric INformation Assurance cLassifyer (SENTINEL).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: KBSI proposes the Secure NeTcentric INformation Assurance cLassifyer (SENTINEL), a distributed semantic and data-driven security classifier that has the ability to semantically classify, manage and filter Cross-Domain Solution (CDS) content. The proposed design would integrate ontology-assisted semantic reasoning, natural language processing, and rule based expert systems to facilitate a robust, cost-effective CDS security clearance guard. The main result of this project would be the research and design of a CDS security clearance guard that is able to securely manage the data from different classifications while preventing 'bleed off' of data into improper security levels and users. The guard will allow for lower clearance users to access information that is filtered to match their security clearance. Similarly, the guard will allow data from all security levels to be managed such that higher levels can access lower security data without the data intermixing or lower levels having access to the higher level systems.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Mixed-mode Simulation-based Executable Architectures (MiMoSEA).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: KBSI proposes to develop a novel methodology and supporting technology to facilitate the verification, validation and quantitative assessment of DoDAF models for systems specification and subsystem integration using mixed-mode (discrete and continuous) simulation techniques. Currently, there exists a modeling gap between the DoDAF architectural specification and the mixed-mode simulation-based representations. We propose to bridge this gap by developing an intermediary mixed-mode Simulation-based Executable Language based on Bond Graphs, Hybrid Bond graphs and Colored Petri Nets. These representations will then be used along with a set of user-specified execution goals to generate a mixed-mode simulation model that can be targeted to different mixed-mode simulation engines. Additionally, the representation will be amenable to the use of rule-based and automated reasoning techniques for qualitative verification and validation. We will elaborately document the Mixed-mode Simulation-based Executable Architectures (MiMoSEA) methodology for model developers, strategic military analysts and systems analysts to develop, modify, validate, and publish DoDAF-based architectures that are quantifiably verifiable and validated and hence useful in DoD systems procurements.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Spectrum Management Optimization and Deconfliction Enhancements (S-MODE).  The abstract given for this project is as follows: Despite the rapid development of innovations supporting advanced communications and other uses of the electromagnetic spectrum, comparatively little progress has been made in the technology base supporting the management and scheduling of limited spectrum resources. The proposed effort will break new ground in the domain of frequency scheduling and management by advancing the science and practical capability to measure and improve the efficiency of frequency scheduling. The key products of the Phase I effort include a set of frequency scheduling optimization methods, scheduling algorithm evaluation results, and a collection of Integrated Frequency Deconfliction System (IFDS) technology augmentation tools targeted at addressing key voids while providing for rapid IFDS capability expansion. The proposed products and approach thus serve to complement Department of Defense (DoD) investments in related frequency management and mission scheduling support technologies. If the proposal is awarded, the Phase II effort will extend upon these developments to refine and harden a comprehensive capability enabling frequency managers to more effectively define, analyze, and generate optimized frequency management strategies, both for advanced planning and real-time metrics adjustment.  Knowledge Based Systems is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: SMART - System for MARitime Targets Recognition and Retrieval.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: We propose to research and design a System for MARitime Targets Recognition and Retrieval. SMART will significantly advance ISAR/Electric-Optics-based ship detection and identification. Unlike existing solutions which focus on the image processing techniques only, the proposed solution integrates image classification, data simulation, and data fusion to achieve reliable and accurate target recognition and retrieval. One key innovation of SMART is its digital vessel model constructor. The vessel model can be constructed off-line and updated when new information concerning the target is available, and when working along with an image simulator, can be used to simulate reference images, which will be compared with the acquired images. Based on the image similarity, and classification results of the acquired images, SMART achieves more reliable and accurate target identification than conventional solutions. The vessel model also bridges the gaps caused by disparate sources and other factors such as view angle and illumination. Images from disparate sources, which are difficult to be compared directly, can be matched with each other through the vessel model.

Asymmetric warfare and operations against transnational terrorist groups would significantly benefit from a new class of multi-attribute behavior signatures for predicting adversary intent and their likely courses of actions. These behavior signatures could potentially draw upon multiple streams of intelligence data, possibly over long temporal durations, to provide direct and indirect indicators of activities of interest. Conceptually, behavior signatures can be considered to be schemas whose attributes delineate a set of characteristics, or patterns of activity, that define the behavior of potential threat entities (consisting of individuals, groups, organizations, societies, and/or nations/states). The activation or realization of a behavior signature for a particular threat entity can be all or nothing or partial, where some, but not all, of the attributes are matched. Research is needed to define selected initial signature libraries, to explore the type of architecture required to use behavior signatures as a computational system (such as probabilistic neural networks, multinomial logistic regression, etc.), and to identify which Air Force systems would benefit most from behavior signatures technology (such as counter intelligence from influence operations).",http://www.metricanet.com

United States,California,Palo Alto,Senseta,Core AI,"Senseta is a company that received a Department of Defense SBIR/STTR grant for a project entitled: Leap-Ahead Control Theoretic Applications.  The abstract given for this project is as follows: When system parameters change abruptly due to, for example, actuator damage in aircraft, or an unknown slung load disturbance in rotorcraft hover control, the use of neural network reconfigurable control has proven to be effective in mitigating the resulting disturbances and returning the controller performance to the desired baseline. Despite its continued success in both the theoretical and practical domains, there still exists a crucial missing link that thwarts not only acceptance in both government and industrial applications, but also the robustness guarantees that indicate how far the system is from instability, and how much time-delay can the feedback loops tolerate. Currently, there is Noequivalent notion of phase and gain margin for neural network adaptive control. We therefore see a critical need to address this division with both sound theoretical analysis and experimental validation. This proposal seeks to (1) develop the analytical techniques necessary to overcome this division, (2) develop a software toolbox built on top of MATLAB to assist the engineer in applying these techniques to a wide range of control problems and (3) perform rigorous simulation based testing on an aircraft with three failure modes, and also on a rotorcraft with unknown sling load attached.",http://senseta.com/
